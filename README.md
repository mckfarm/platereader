# platereader

Repository for plate reader analysis scripts for the Wells Lab.

Prepare microplate layout and run assay ➡ retrieve output file from plate reader ➡ estimate assay target from calibration curve

Microplate analyses run on Synergy HTX microplate reader in the Hartmann lab. Scripts designed for 96 well plates, though any plate size should be okay.
