# platereader

Repository for plate reader analysis scripts for the Wells Lab. Microplate analyses run on Synergy HTX microplate reader in the Hartmann lab. Scripts designed for 96 well plates, though any plate size should be okay.

Workflow is as follows:

Prepare microplate layout and run assay ➡ retrieve output file from plate reader ➡ estimate assay target from calibration curve


Nutrient assays:
Follow the format of the Excel file saved in the data folder. This spreadsheet can contain all of your data from start to finish of the workflow: microplate layout, sample IDs and dilutions, standards, results, and notes. I typically save the output text file from the Synergy HTX, then copy the absorbance values into an Excel file. An example of the microplate output is also in the data file.

Intracellular polymer assays:
